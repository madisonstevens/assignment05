                <h1>Paris Texas is a scenic place.</h1>
                <p>There is a classic film (that I have not seen) called <span id="wim">Paris Texas</span> it was directed by Wim Winders. Essentially, Paris is a magical place filled with Texans and black dirt. Paris, TX is south of the Red Dirt River Valley in Southern Oklahoma and Northern Texas. It has a fair amount of tornadoes, one of which I survived. While in Paris, mostly I went to Walmart and Starbucks. That's all they had there. Sometimes I went to the little stores owned by locals, they were okay but too religious for me. In Paris I worked on a dairy farm treating sick cows, it was pretty rad. I drove a sweet 1997 Ford F150 to Texas and back to my home in Massachusetts. Texas was a great place and I recommend that you visit. Check out the eiffel tower if you're in Paris! Also go to Popeye's.</p>
                <h3>I took a few pictures in my time in Paris.</h3>
                <p id="part_2">The top picture is the best one I took, it was in Hugo, OK. The middle photo was from a rodeo I went to. Rodeos are fun to watch but hard to document. The last photo is my backyard, I lived in a doublewide in front of a corn field and near a bunch of dirt.</p>
